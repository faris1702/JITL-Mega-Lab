# JITL-Mega-Lab
This is a Cisco Packet Tracer lab based on Jeremy's IT Lab CCNA Course - Mega Lab. The link to the video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/2p7-MluKAgE). This lab is very beneficial for those who plan to take the CCNA. It covers all the topics in which the configuration is tested in the CCNA and even those that are not tested (e.g. SNMP, FTP).
